          <p><em>Hello everyone, </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Sorry site went down earlier than anticipated, the host pulled the plug sooner than I thought it would.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>PULL has served a good purpose for many years--it's been a safe place where people could express themselves. However, I'm afraid that there are some deep issues with its culture that I can't fix.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I've been trying to find a new administrator for a long time, it hasn't worked out. I've given splinter sites time and support to form but they haven't worked out.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I've decided closing PULL is the best option. I'm going to retain the domain because I truly believe the site should not be remade. </em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for everything. Serving this community has had its ups and downs, but I'll always be proud of what we made together. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>- Nyx, 7/20/2020</em></p>
